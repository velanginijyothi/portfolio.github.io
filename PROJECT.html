    <b><u><h2>MINI PROJECT</h2></u></b>
<h3>“REAL TIME FACE MASK DETECTION AND RECOGNITION USING OPEN CV “by using python</h3>
The prediction of Developed a real-time face mask detection and recognition 
system using OpenCV and Python programming language. The system utilized 
computer vision techniques to detect and recognize whether a person is wearing a 
face mask or not. Key responsibilities and achievements include: Gathered a 
diverse dataset of images, Preprocessed the collected images, Split the dataset into 
training and testing sets, and annotated the images to label mask-wearing status.</span>

  <b><u><h2>MAIN PROJECT</h2></u></b>
<h3>PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS FOR BIG MART SALES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND ALGORITHMS</h3>
The project can be further collaborated in a web-based application or in any device 
supported with an in-built intelligence by virtue of Internet of Things (IOT), to be more 
feasible for use. Various stakeholders concerned with sales information can also 
provide more inputs to help in hypothesis generation and more instances can be taken
into consideration such that more preciseresults that are closer to real world situations
are generated.
