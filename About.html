I am challa Velangini Jyothi, born and brought up in guntur. Thank you for allowing me to introduce myself. I 
scored 8.3 gpa in my school at Auxilium English Medium High School. I scored 8.03 gpa in Intermediate  at Narayana
junior college, and  I scored 6.7 gpa in Gradution  at Chalapathi Institute of Technology.

I believe my strength is my attitude, and I like to take up challenges and think to accept both success and failure 
in a balanced way to move forward. I want to say that I don't leave any questions altogether as I believe in myself 
and my work.

My short-term goal is to find a platform to expand my career and grow with the organization. And my long-term goal is
 to be the cause of the organization's success. Therefore, I always challenge myself to improve my progress and steady
 growth.

That's all about me, sir/madam. Thank you for providing me with such an excellent opportunity to introduce myself.
